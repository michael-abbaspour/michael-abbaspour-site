		answer: "When I was starting my own lawn care/landscaping business, I began planning my marketing strategy." +

Although those tools are relatively low-code and I would eventually stop using them, I fell in love with the design planning and building process. So much so, I began enjoying it more than performing the actual services my company was meant for. Thatâ€™s when I knew that I needed to switch careers."
